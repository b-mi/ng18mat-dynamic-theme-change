# ng18mat-dynamic-theme-change
A truly functional Angular Material 18 theme changer (currently probably the only existing one)

After many days of unsuccessful and desperate search for a solution based on the official documentation, searching the web, github, npm.js, searching for a solution, trying and testing various, always outdated solutions, it was possible to find a simple and functional solution based on the dynamic setting of prebuild themes. I also wanted to write on the Angular-Material github if they could link to a single (ONLY ONE) complete working solution that allows you to dynamically switch between light and dark themes, instead of partial code snippets, but I didn't believe they would.
